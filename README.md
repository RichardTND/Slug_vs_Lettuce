# Slug_vs_Lettuce
Single screen platform game for Scene World game tutorial

Slug VS Lettuce is a Public Domain platform survival game written for Scene World issue 32 disk mag. The game was made to cover the tutorial LET'S MAKE A C64 GAME.
The source code was made using KickAssembler V5, but may also work on lower or higher versions of Kick Assembler. The project folder has also been modified to work 
with the newest version of CBMPRGSTUDIO (V4) as Artur's update now supports KickAssembler. 

In order to get the KickAssembler source to assemble and run correctly in CBMPRGStudio, please edit the configuration file (Slug_vs_Lettuce.cfg) and edit the 
execute path too match your own :)
 
- execute "device:\path\vice\x64sc.exe" slugvslettuce.prg
(e.g. c:\c64\tools\vice\x64sc.exe)

Please feel free to play around with the source code, music, etc or use the code make your own projects if you want to make your own games.

Thanks :)
