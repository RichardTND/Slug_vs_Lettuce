ABOUT THE GAME

Slug vs Lettuce is a fun little single
screen platform game. The aim of this
little game is to help your slug 
jump onto the platforms and feed it
as much lettuce as you possibly can.

There is one problem. The cave in 
which the slug is quite deadly. Giant
water droplets appear from the top
and fall at varied speed. If the
water hits your slug, then you will
lose one life. You will be protected
for a short period of time but, once
your shield has run out, you will 
become more vulnerable to the water.

You quest is also for survival. You
will have approximately 10 minutes
to survive before all of your lives
have run out. If you survive you 
win. 

Extra lives are given after one
minute has expired unless of 
course you already have 9 lives.

Keep on scoring as many points as 
you possibly can. Have fun!
